# Amplify

### Notes from Armaan 
This folder was generated by following the steps outlined
at the [getting started documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/react) for Amplify.

Working with amplify is done mostly through the CLI and through the AWS admin
interface. 

Using amplify is definitely not something I'm bound to, but it does provide some
useful tools for authentication and hosting data storage. Please take a look
around the project and see what you think. It's not too late to
switch to a plain node js or google firebase backend.

This folder serves mostly as configuration for the cloud-hosted systems that
Amplify runs, and to provide some information that the react app uses to
communicate with the backend. When changes are made to this folder, the changes
need to be deployed to the cloud environment by running `amplify push`. We may also
need to sometimes run `amplify pull` to fetch changes that have been deployed by
another teammember to the environment, but which your local Amplify folder does not
yet reflect. There is more information about this [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/teams/overview) and [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/teams/shared).

#### Running the project locally after pulling
Firstly, I'm not sure if you even need to install the amplify CLI if you're going to
only be working on the frontend and will not be changing the amplify environment. You may 
just be able to start the react app as usual, while being able to make requests to the 
backend so you can properly develop the frontend. I have never tried this though
so I'm not sure. 

If you are going to be editing the amplify environment you'll need to install
the amplify CLI (see the "getting started documentation" link above). From reading 
[this](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/teams/shared), I think this is what you
should do next:
Run `amplify init` in the react app directory. You'll be asked whether to use an existing
environment. You should select Yes. There should only be one choice of
environment to choose from which is dev.
